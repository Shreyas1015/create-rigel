# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-19

> Ships the template-facing half of PLAN-004: the **advisory judges** (safe, log-only, never
> block). The golden-set harness that calibrates/regresses them lives in `evals/` and is
> intentionally **not published** (repo-internal); its reference solutions + live runner are
> deferred. So this release adds a coherent advisory feature to scaffolded projects without
> shipping anything half-built.

### Added

- **Judges + golden-set harness (PLAN-004, Phase 1 part 2) — machinery.** The judgment-shaped
  remainder PLAN-003's deterministic checks can't cover. Everything ships **advisory**; nothing
  blocks until mechanically calibrated.
  - **Advisory spec-conformance judge** (`spec-judge` agent, all templates) — reads only the
    spec + diff (never the transcript), emits per-AC + intent + abstraction verdicts
    (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN) into the plan log, routing UNKNOWN to `.rigel/judge-review-queue/`.
    Wired into `/garbage-collect` as a log-only step. New `judge` role (opus) in
    `model-routing.json`.
  - **Advisory vision judge** (`vision-judge` agent, nextjs) — layout sanity only (hierarchy /
    spacing-sanity / state-completeness); token adherence stays the deterministic AC-6 check.
    Screenshot capture via `tests/design/capture-screens.spec.ts`.
  - **Golden-set harness** in `evals/` (repo-level, unpublished, zero-dep): three frozen golden
    specs; a "no green reference, no entry" loader; per-check trial scoring with pass^k and
    ERRORED≠FAILED; regression detection (fail ≥2/3 AND baseline-passed, with the METR
    "human reads the transcript" rule); champion/challenger via a two-sided sign-flip test;
    a calibration harness with the deterministic-overlap bootstrap and per-dimension κ; and the
    grader cost-down (opus-vs-cheaper) parity experiment.
  - **Mechanical promotion gate** (`promotion-check.mjs`, in `repo-integrity.yml`): a judge
    dimension may go blocking only by citing a fresh (≤90-day), threshold-meeting calibration
    report — CI refuses otherwise. The judge model is pinned (documented exception to no-pins).
  - Solo-maintainer honest by construction: with one labeler, human-vs-human κ isn't
    established, so judge-exclusive dimensions stay reduced-confidence and advisory rather than
    inventing a κ; only deterministic-overlap dimensions can be promoted.

### Note

- Deferred to a later pass (infra/API-heavy): the golden **reference solutions**, the live
  **`run-trial.mjs`** runner (headless agent execution + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), and the golden
  nightly workflow. All deterministic harness logic is complete and tested on fixtures
  (`npm run test:evals`).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Deterministic evals (PLAN-003, Phase 1) across all four templates.** Closes the
  spec→evidence loop with mechanically-enforced, LLM-free checks. No agent can claim an
  acceptance criterion by self-report; it must produce a test that was proven red, is
  non-vacuous, and passes.
  - **AC-ID traceability + per-AC vector.** Specs now write stable `AC-N` ids; every id must
    map to an acceptance test whose title carries it. `scripts/ac-vector.*` grades the outcome
    at feature completion (`PASS` / `FAIL` / `MISSING` / `INVALID`) into the plan's progress log.
  - **Holdout enforcement.** `tests/acceptance/` is a fail-closed holdout: the post-write hook
    blocks edits there (exit 2) unless `/write-spec` has set `.rigel/acceptance.unlock`, backed
    by a CODEOWNERS lead-review line.
  - **Spec-phase scaffolding + red-green proof.** `/write-spec` scaffolds one failing acceptance
    test per AC; `scripts/redgreen-record.*` requires every one to fail pre-implementation
    (recorded to `.rigel/redgreen/`), and `/write-plan` refuses specs lacking tests + proof.
  - **Assertion integrity.** An AST check (TS compiler API for TS templates, `ast` for fastapi)
    fails any AC-claiming test with zero/trivial/snapshot-only assertions.
  - **Design-token conformance (nextjs).** A deterministic Playwright check diffs rendered
    computed styles against a `DESIGN.md` token list; per-dimension, opt-in enforcement.
  - **Mutation audit (nightly alarm).** Stryker (TS) / mutmut (fastapi) run nightly on the
    acceptance holdout and open an issue below the 60% floor — never a merge gate.
  - Per-gate cost stays flat: only the *static* traceability + assertion-integrity checks run
    in the per-layer gate; the green vector runs at feature completion.

### Fixed

- **express jest never ran in a clean environment.** The `ts-jest` ESM preset requires
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules`, which no script/CI set — so `npm test`, `npm run
  gate`, and CI silently reported "0 tests". Added the flag to the jest scripts.
- **nestjs post-write hook never saw the edited path** (read only top-level `file_path`, not
  the nested `tool_input.file_path` Claude Code sends), and the express/fastapi/nestjs hooks
  could crash under `set -u` with no warnings. Both fixed.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- **Reworked the branch model to keep `main` the source of truth with isolated feature
  promotion.** Replaces the previous `feature → staging → main` promotion flow. Every
  template's `.rigel/git-policy.json` (and the hooks, skills, CI, and docs that read it) now
  encodes:
  - Feature branches are **cut from and rebased on `main`** (never on `staging`/`drop`), so a
    feature promotes to `main` carrying only its own changes.
  - A new disposable **`drop`** deploy-trigger branch: merging a feature into `drop` deploys it
    to the stage server for testing. `drop` never merges upward and is intentionally unprotected.
  - **Two promotion paths onto `main`:** *urgent* (`feature → main`, to ship one verified
    feature immediately, isolated from staging's other in-flight work — gated on a full CI pass
    plus a documented canary/smoke) and *batch* (`staging → main`, to promote the whole verified
    stage release). `staging` mirrors the last validated stage state.
  - `/sync-branch` now rebases onto `main`; `/open-pr` chooses base + merge method for the
    deploy/urgent/batch/hotfix flows; `pre-push` and the git-policy CI recognize `drop`;
    `docs/git-workflow.md` documents the model, one-time `drop`+`staging` setup, and the
    "test ≠ ship" caveat on the urgent path.

  The deploy pipeline that advances `staging` after stage tests pass is intentionally left for
  the consuming project to wire (it's environment-specific).

### Added

- **Template-level git workflow enforcement.** Every scaffolded project now inherits an
  enforced (not remembered) git workflow, driven by a single source of truth:
  - `.rigel/git-policy.json` — the branch model (`main` + `staging`), branch-name and
    Conventional-Commit patterns, and per-branch merge strategy + protection. Byte-identical
    across all four templates; every hook, skill, script, and CI job reads from it.
  - `.githooks/commit-msg` + `.githooks/pre-push` — toolchain-free POSIX-shell hooks
    (no husky, no node/python needed) that reject non-Conventional-Commit messages and
    off-pattern branch names locally. Identical across every template; activated at
    `/infra-setup` via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. A stack-specific
    `.githooks/pre-commit` runs each template's own linters.
  - `/sync-branch` and `/open-pr` skills — rebase-onto-base + re-gate, and PR creation with
    base/merge-method chosen from the policy and the body auto-filled from the active PLAN.
  - `scripts/protect-branch.sh` (applies `main` + `staging` protection via `gh api`) and
    `scripts/check-protection-drift.sh` (fails CI if live protection drifts from the policy).
  - `.github/workflows/git-policy.yml` — enforces branch name, Conventional Commits over the
    PR range, a required PLAN reference, and protection drift on every PR.
  - `.github/CODEOWNERS` (added for the nestjs and fastapi templates) and
    `docs/git-workflow.md` documenting the branch model and one-time protection setup.

### Changed

- Templates activate git hooks via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` instead of husky.
  Removed the nextjs template's `.husky/` directory and its `prepare: husky` script; the
  fastapi template drives its existing `pre-commit` toolchain from `.githooks/pre-commit`
  rather than `pre-commit install`. Each template's `/infra-setup` was rewired accordingly.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- `model-routing.json` — a single source of truth mapping agent roles
  (`orchestrator` / `worker` / `grader`) to models. Every template agent's `model:`
  frontmatter is generated from and CI-checked against it, and the file is stamped into
  each scaffolded project so runtime role routing has a policy to read.
- `/build-layer` role escalation: after two failed gate attempts on the same layer, the
  build escalates from the `worker` role to the `orchestrator` role and appends a
  structured, greppable lesson record to `docs/exec-plans/lessons.log`.
- `scripts/check-model-routing.js` — checks (or, with `--write`, regenerates) agent
  frontmatter against `model-routing.json`.
- `repo-integrity` CI workflow: fails the build on leaked absolute paths in a shipped
  `settings.json`, on model-routing drift, or on leftover legacy brand identifiers.

### Changed

- Normalized every template's agent models onto the shared role table: enforcement
  agents (`gate-checker`, `reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `contract-checker`) and
  `arch-validator` run on `opus`; workers (`db-optimizer`, `doc-gardener`,
  `garbage-collector`, `perf-auditor`) run on `sonnet`. This replaces the previous
  per-template model pins that disagreed with each other.
- Normalized the `nestjs` template's default session model to match the other templates.

### Fixed

- Completed the `create-harness` → `create-rigel` rename across the CLI banner, smoke-test
  temp-directory prefix, contributing guide, issue template, and the `express` template's
  package name, description, keywords, and gitleaks config title.

### Security

- Removed absolute local filesystem paths accidentally included in the `fastapi` template's
  `.claude/settings.json` (both `permissions.allow` entries and the `additionalDirectories`
  list). Scaffolded fastapi projects no longer reference the maintainer's local machine.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Initial release of `rigel` (`create-rigel`).
- Scaffolder CLI (`npm create rigel`) with an interactive stack picker.
- Four templates: `nextjs`, `express`, `nestjs`, `fastapi` — each with a `.claude/`
  workflow (rules, review agents, numbered skill pipeline) and a docs taxonomy.
- Smoke test that scaffolds every template in CI (Node 18/20/22).
- Publish-on-tag GitHub Actions workflow with npm provenance.
